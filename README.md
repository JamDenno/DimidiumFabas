There was once a society of beans long ago, in a distant land. They were a special society, for they bore the ability to glow in the dark. But one day, there was one bean who surpassed them all, evolving to have something quite unlike a typical bean - Arms. The rest of bean society shunned him and tried to exile him, and in his rage he fought back, eradicating his fellow beans, his brethren. Torn by the trauma of his evolution, and of the loss of his friends and family, the bean's mind was fractured in two. Now he must find a balance between his two sides, one of light and one dark. But the path of light and dark are both equally dangerous, so you will have to overcome obstacles that are thrown at you, lest you succumb to the traumas inside your head. This is... Half-Bean
